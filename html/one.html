                <h1>Bangalore</h1>
                <p>
                    The city's history dates back to around 890 CE, as found in a stone inscription found at the Nageshwara Temple in Begur, Bangalore.
                    In 1537 CE, Kemp√© GowdƒÅ, a feudal ruler under the Vijayanagara Empire, established a mud fort, considered the foundation of modern
                    Bangalore and its oldest areas, or p√©t√©s, which still exist. After the fall of the Vijayanagara Empire, Kempe Gowda declared
                    independence; in 1638, a large Adil Shahi Bijapur army defeated Kempe Gowda III, and Bangalore was came under Shahaji Bhonsle as a
                    jagir which later became his capital.
